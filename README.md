# bbPress Better Permalinks

The plugin alters bbPress topic url's so they include the hierarchy of the forums they belong to.

Example lets say we have a forum post with the title ```Obi Wan Kenobi``` Normally this would mean that the path to your topic would be something like: ```/topic/obi-wan-kenobi``` Now lets say that your topic belongs to the forum named ```Jedi knights``` which in turn has a parent form named ```Star Wars```. Normally in bbPress our topic path has no indication of what forum the topic belongs to. With the example above the new topic path generated by the plugin will be the following: ```/forum/star-wars/jedi-knights/topic/obi-wan-kenobi``` now if we look at the url we can see the topic path has been prefixed with the parent forums, correctly indicating its relationship to them.

**Note that the parts ```forum``` and ```topic``` can be altered by changing the bbPress slug settings, but they have to be part of the url for the plugin to work**

## Installation

The plugin can be installed through composer:

``` bash
composer require bonnier/bbpress-better-permalinks

```

Or by fetching the latest zip from: https://github.com/BenjaminMedia/bbpress-better-permalinks/releases

The plugin automatically clears the wordpress permalinks upon activation/deactivation, so simply activating the plugin should be enough to generate new permalinks for your topics.

Please note that if you change the slug settings for bbPress then you have to manually visit the permalinks settings page to generate new permalinks for the topics.
